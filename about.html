		       		<p>
		       			Vellore, a district capital in Tamil Nadu, has long been known for its stately fort and temple, renowned hospital and medical college, Parry's factories and the vast government industrial estate in nearby Ranipet. Vellore's history records several dynasties and powers. The Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas, Hoysalas, Sambhurvarayars, Chalukyas, Vijayanagar, Bijapur Sultans, Mughals, Marathas, French and the British have all ruled the area at one point of time or the other. The twenty or more palaces and forts in the district reflect ancient styles and traditions. The most striking of these is the famous Vellore Fort, built in the 16th Century by Chinna Bommi Nayak of Vijayanagar. The fort was declared a national monument in 1992. The Jalakandeswara Temple inside the fort is an imposing example of Vijayanagar architecture. The temple, now renovated, is known for its exquisite sculptures. There are scores of other temples and shrines in the area. Among these, the ancient rock-cut Jain cave temples attract heritage enthusiasts from all over the world for their rich art and beautiful sculpture.
